                        Welcome to the interactive visualization of a dataset of photos from flickr. This visualization let's you pick photographs from their geographic location. Then a common ground between these photo's is shown in a graph that is drawn after making your choices. This graph shows how through the labels the common categories are depicted or how through the categories the common labels are depicted. Underneath are a couple of examples on why and how this is usefull and what this visualization can bring you.

With the statistics of the photoâ€™s added you can also see the views of the photos on flickr and the potential.

                        <li>Or, as an experencied user, you want to search for hotspots for new photo locations. Searching your favorite category or tag, you can compare two hotspots and the amount of views of those hotspots. The statistics of the geography show the comparison between the hotspots. The labels and tags show you if the photos are describing your favorite subjects.</li>
